Subjective Age: 28
Realtime Age : 47
Ring: Kunlan Line - Liushi II

Recorded History:

Born in core space, Hikaru Suko by all appearances had a traditional upbringing, from schooling to family there is little to note beyond her soon to be apparent need to push boundaries in her life. With the risk of perceived stagnation growing greater with every passing year, she instead chose to shed the comforts of home entirely. She enlisted.

At the age of twenty-four she'd found herself recruited into the Golden Hand, a youth in her prime. Only after a year through her tour, proving herself in the Dawnline Shore against competitor and company alike had her capabilities been noted. With reaction speed far surpassing many and the ability to function under immense cognitive stress, she proved a worthy candidate for piloting mechanized frames. It's there she appeared to find what she was after, to be truly tested in sorties that stretched far beyond what one was capable on foot. Yet resources are as ever finite, and so was her patience when she was held in reserve so less costly means of resolving conflicts could be fielded.

Broken(?) Her contract, it's then the promising pilot shifted away from company work, instead seeking the challenging life as a freelancer.
